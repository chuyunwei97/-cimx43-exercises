# CIM 443 Front End Fundamentals Exercise - Poem
  Made by {Chuyun Wei}
1. What were you trying to accomplish? What was the tutorial or inspiration you tried to work with?
    I would like to make a poetry book with page turning animation. Viewers can select a chapter in the table of contents or return to the home page.

2. What was the most frustrating part of working on this exercise? The most rewarding?
    The design of the book did not achieve the desired effect; it was not realistic enough.
    The animation of turning left and right pages is smooth and successful.
3. Would you do this exercise again?
    No. I'd like to try a different animation next time.
4. What would you change if you had another week?
    I would consider adding a background to the book to make it more vivid. I can also add a search box that lets users search chapters by keyword.
